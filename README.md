Project Shiny App link: https://groupecfpb.shinyapps.io/Group_E_Financial_Product_Complaint/ 

Brief introduction: Each week, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sends thousands of consumersâ€™ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Those complaints are published after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Every consumer complaint provides insight into problems that people are experiencing, helping companies identify inappropriate practices and allowing companies to stop them before they become major issues. We are interested in finding out how is status quo of consumer finance complaints across the US, and the insights and problems behind the trend. Please see the details of our findings through the link above.
